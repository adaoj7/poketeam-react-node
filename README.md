# Poketeam Randomizer built with React and Node.js

This project is similar to my other Pokemon randomizer, but I am looking to build a node backend before I get into Python and then architect the Python after.

I think that finding the app that I found yesterday should be able to help me understand the pokeAPI better.

# Things that I have already implemented:

Random pokemon and shiny generated with button press
Random team given for gen 1-3

# Ideas to implement:

I need a way to show base stats, moveset, and final evolution in the randomizer so I am not stuck playing with the basic evolution
I would ideally like this project to provide teams according to the generation and what pokemon appear in each game.
I need to also create a db that allows me to persist my teams
I need a way to save individual pokemon on each team

# Next steps for development

I think the next step is to display the stats of each pokemon and movesets when they are clicked on using a breadcrumb menu or something similar for back navigation. This should work because data can be persisted in the backend for the front end to query. I will model out data when I get to that point.
